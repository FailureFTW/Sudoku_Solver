This is a Sudoku Solver created by me, Jacob Allison.
- It uses several methods of deductive reasoning to eliminate possibilities of all the squares.
- This is able to solve almost any puzzle using only a fraction of the methods and algorithms that can be used, as well as a guess and check function in case it gets stuck.
- It still needs cleaning up, as well as improvement and optimization.
